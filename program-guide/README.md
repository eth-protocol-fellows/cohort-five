## Technical resources

Research and development around core Ethereum protocol is very rich. Many topics you can deep dive to, study and build for months or years. Here are some useful overviews with sources to learn more about various Ethereum areas: 

- [EPF Study Group and Protocol Wiki](https://epf.wiki)
- [Suggested reading](./reading.md) list with high level overview of areas in Ethereum protocol
- [EthR&D Discord Guidebook](https://github.com/tvanepps/EthereumDiscordGuidebook) 
   - This guide contains many sources for orientation, not only for the R&D Discord but all of Ethereum R&D.
   - If you find anything useful which would fit in there, feel free to contribute by expanding it.
- `Advanced` category in [Ethereum.org developer docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/) can get you started on many current protocol dev topics
- [Ethereum.org roadmap page](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/#looking-for-specific-technical-upgrades) has excellent articles explaining changes coming to the protocol.

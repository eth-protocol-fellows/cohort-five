# How to Participate in EPF

EPF is an open, public and permissionless program. Anyone can participate by joining our regular calls, Discord channel and submitting regular updates. 

## Dive In

EPF starts by learning about the core protocol. Visit the [EPF Wiki](https://epf.wiki) and get started immersing yourself in the various Ethereum protocol topics. Contribute to the wiki to cover gaps in content you find interesting and add any materials you discover yourself.

## Choose a project

Based on your learning experience about the protocol, identify missing pieces and projects to contribute. Mentors have [suggested various projects](/projects/project-ideas.md) that you can work on but you are encouraged to work on a project that you feel interested in or inspired by. Choose a project that you would like to build or contribute to on during the duration of the program and write its specification. Your project does not need to be completed at the end of the program but you are expected to make progress during the five months of the program. 

## Participate in the discussion

Join the Ethereum R&D Discord. Use the *#protocol-fellowship* channel for general discussion but use the appropriate channels for conversations regarding specific topics, especially if you are seeking assistance or feedback from a mentor. Please keep this discussion relevant to what you are working on. Our intention is to keep these channels open, but if there is a lot of noise, restrictions may be added. You can also use the [Study Group discord](https://discord.gg/hFrSEHyjYZ)to discuss learning materials and contributions to the wiki. 

## Make weekly updates

Weekly updates help us to see how you are progressing in your project. Making an update each week will not only keep you accountable to your project, but it will also track your ability to do the work. Additionally, weekly updates help you practice technical writing, explaining your ideas to others through written posts, which is one of the primary ways that infomation about Ethereum is spread. Remember that our goal is to help you find placement with a client team, research team, or help you to become a funded independent contributor.

*How to make weekly updates*
- Follow the guidelines in the [Repo Guide](./repo-guide.md)
- Post your update or a link to your update in the [Development Updates](/development-updates.md)
- Link your update in the weekly update thread in *#protocol-fellowship*

## Get help from Mentors

The EPF has a pool of [mentors](./mentors.md) that are here to assist your process. They can unlock roadblocks, give feedback on your progress, or help point you in the right direction if you are stuck. Mentors are NOT here to teach you how to do things, tell you what to do or hold you accountable to your project. 

>Please be respectful of mentors’ time. Try to figure it out on your own first. If asking for help is necessary, be concise and direct.

*How to interact with mentors*
- Ask a question in the #protocol-fellowship channel and tag them.
- Ask a specific question about the topic you are working on in the appropriate channel
- If an ongoing conversation is necessary, ask the mentor for a direct message contact
- Add a comment in the [Office Hours](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/issues) issue in the GitHub repo for the upcoming meeting outlining the problem you are having or the discussion you would like to happen

## Join weekly meetings

There will be 2 meetings every week. One will be a weekly stand-up meeting, where you can discuss your progress with other participants. The second is the Office Hours meeting, where mentors will be present to discuss the topics that have been raised in the GitHub issue for that week. Both of these meetings are open to all participants.

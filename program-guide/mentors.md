## How to get mentorship

In general, program participants are expected to take personal responsibility for their work. Working as a core developer requires you to be able to do self-directed work, and this program is no different. You should speak up and ask when you have questions, but you should also take responsibility for asking well informed questions.

Mentors from above list are open to help you during the program. They can propose project ideas, answer your questions, and guide you if you get stuck. Keep in mind that each mentor has different capacity since they work on the protocol full time.

Mentors are primarily available in R&D Discord channel and some will occasionally attend EPF standup calls. If you didn't get your invite to the server or cannot reach a mentor, reach out to cohort organizers.

Each mentor is covering a certain area of the protocol and representing their development team. If you choose a project they proposed or your project is within their area, suggest setting up a project group for easier communication. Otherwise, ask for the advice in Discord channel.

Make sure to do your own research before you ask a question, e.g. making sure something like this hasn't been discussed previously in the channel or answered at stackexchange. If the questions targets a specific mentor, feel free to tag them. Your question should be technical and topical. Avoid general and unnecessary messages.

# Verkle Tree Optimization for Stateless Ethereum Client

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum network by researching, optimizing, and contributing to the implementation of Verkle Trees for state storage and retrieval. By leveraging Verkle Trees, we aim to reduce storage requirements and improve transaction validation times, aiding in the transition to a stateless client architecture.

## Problem Statement
The current state storage in Ethereum is becoming increasingly large and difficult to manage, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs. This project addresses these challenges by contributing to the development and optimization of Verkle Trees, which offer more efficient state storage and retrieval.

## Proposed Solution
The solution involves:
- **Research and Understanding:** In-depth study of Verkle Trees, their current state, and existing issues.
- **Optimization:** Identifying and implementing optimizations for Verkle Trees, focusing on proof size and generation time.
- **Contribution:** Contributing to existing Ethereum improvement proposals and implementations related to Verkle Trees.
- **Prototype:** Developing a basic prototype demonstrating Verkle Tree integration with Ethereum clients.

## Implementation Details
### Research and Design
- Study existing literature and implementations of Verkle Trees, including EIP-6800.
- Understand current challenges and limitations.
- Define project specifications and goals based on research findings.

### Optimization
- Identify potential areas for optimization in current Verkle Tree implementations, particularly in proof size and generation time.
- Implement and test optimizations in a controlled environment.

### Contribution
- Collaborate with the Ethereum community to contribute optimizations and improvements.
- Submit pull requests and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) based on findings.

### Prototype Development
- Develop a basic prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of Verkle Tree integration.
- Test the prototype on a testnet to gather data and insights.

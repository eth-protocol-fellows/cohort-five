# reth-verkle PoC
This project will involve migration of reth EL-client from merkle tries to verkle tries, and enable it to act as a stateless client.


## Motivation

stateless-cleints are very much necessary for the decentralisation of ethereum, due to following reasons:

1. ethereum's current state size is too large for many nodes to keep in working memory, requiring expensive SSDs for storage and slowing down block validation and chain syncing, stateless clients will allow validators to validate blocks without maintaining the full state, significantly reducing their resource requirements and also reducing sync times.
2. using verkle tries for stateless makes client architecture is more compatible with a Zk-EVM future, with some added explored benefits like increasing of gas-limits to large extents.

the main motivation of creating a reth-verkle poc is is to develop more working implementation of verkle-integration in EL-clients, which will help in running interop with other clients, further research and allow reth to prepare for the verge, learn more about why statelessness is important here: [Why it's so important to go stateless](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html#fnref:3)

## Project description

this project aims to integrate [rust-verkle](https://github.com/crate-crypto/rust-verkle) crytographic primitives into [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), and enable it to act as a stateless client.
a basic TL;DR will be:
* allow construction of witness during block-execution.
* propogation of this witness along with block, for stateless validation by other clients.
* obtain pre-state from verkle-block witness, when cross-validating statelessly.
* then execute a block statelessly using this witness, instead of the local chain.

## Specification

Technical specifications will involve following the defined [specs](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip#Header-values) and [Verkle serialization format in SSZ](https://notes.ethereum.org/Si5tEWlMTYerkhG3fOIAMQ) for making changes in reth:
1. A block/execution witness (i.e: the verkle proof required to execute a block statelessly) struct will be created, this is an SSZ-encoded serialization of the following ExecutionWitness structure:
    ```
    class ExecutionWitness(container):
        state_diff: StateDiff
        verkle_proof: VerkleProof
    ```
2. `state_diff` will contain all the pre-state data required to execute the given block, which will then be executed statelessly by other clients(basically verkle trie's, leaf node's key value pair), `StateDiff` defination:

    ```
    MAX_STEMS = 2**16
    VERKLE_WIDTH = 256

    class SuffixStateDiff(Container):
        suffix: Byte

        # Null means not currently present
        current_value: Union[Null, Bytes32]

        # Null means value not updated
        new_value: Union[Null, Bytes32]

    class StemStateDiff(Container):
        stem: Stem
        # Valid only if list is sorted by suffixes
        suffix_diffs: List[SuffixStateDiff, VERKLE_WIDTH]

    # Valid only if list is sorted by stems
    StateDiff = List[StemStateDiff, MAX_STEMS]
    ```
3. `verkle_proof` will contain, all the data needed by the verifier to re-construct a partial view of the pre-state trie(using commitments, root-node, and given block values) for the data present in `state_diff`, which will be used to prove that this pre-state data provided is indeed part of the trie whose root-node is the `state_root_node`(trusted), already present with the client, `VerkleProof` defination:

    ```
    BandersnatchGroupElement = Bytes32
    BandersnatchFieldElement = Bytes32
    MAX_COMMITMENTS_PER_STEM = 33 # = 31 for inner nodes + 2 (C1/C2)
    IPA_PROOF_DEPTH = 8 # = log2(VERKLE_WIDTH)

    class IpaProof(Container):
        C_L = Vector[BandersnatchGroupElement, IPA_PROOF_DEPTH]
        C_R = Vector[BandersnatchGroupElement, IPA_PROOF_DEPTH]
        final_evaluation = BandersnatchFieldElement

    class VerkleProof(Container):
        // [Group A]
        other_stems: List[Bytes32, MAX_STEMS]
        depth_extension_present: List[uint8, MAX_STEMS]
        commitments_by_path: List[BandersnatchGroupElement, MAX_STEMS * MAX_COMMITMENTS_PER_STEM]
        // [Group B]
        D: BandersnatchGroupElement
        ipa_proof: IpaProof
    ```
    here, `other_stems`, `depth_extension_present`, `commitments_by_path` are data used to construct this partial-view of verkle-trie, and `ipa_proof` is the verkle proof which will be used to open the commitment in the path from provided leaf-nodes to the trie-root, which will prove that the provided data is indeed correct

4. Above changes will require modification in EL-client, to retrive particular state-values to construct block-witness, use this witness and remove local-chain for validation, networking level changes for propagation of witness, removal of MPTs and switch to VPTs, and associated DB-related changes.




## Roadmap

1. Jul - mid august: understanding of geth and ethereumJs client implementation, and rust-verkle cryptography.
2. mid august - end sept: implementation of the proposed changes.
3. october - devcon: testing and proper benchmarking of the proposed changes.

## Possible challenges

This is a long project, and will require deep understanding of not only verkle related cryptography but complete EL client architecture, from database modeling(for trie modifications), evm as well(fetching appropiate storage data for witness), networking-protocol(for propogation of witness)
Once the code-base is ready, testing and proper benchmarking of the peformance will be the most difficult bottlneck which can then involve further implementations of optimising techniques to boost performance.

## Goal of the project

The end goal of this project will be achieved if reth is able to join the latest iteration of Kaustinen devnet(devnet for verkle-tries), passing all MPT-VPT transition tests and EL-spec tests for this change, with proper performance comparable to other client implementations.

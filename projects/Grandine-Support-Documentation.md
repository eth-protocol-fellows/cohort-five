# Grandine Support and Documentation

This project is focused on building out a more comprehensive support and documentation book for Grandine through research and trial and error. 

## Motivation

Grandine is the newest Consensus Layer client and the documentation is on the lighter side. I think it's important to have more comprehsneive documentation around Grandine and its capabilities. I also think this will help attract new users to the client, which would increase client diversity among CL clients.

## Project description

I am proposing to add more support and documentation to [Grandine's book](https://github.com/grandinetech/grandine/tree/develop/book) which will require me to become intimately familiar with Grandine through research and trial and error. 

The following areas are ones I think should be addressed but this is likely to change as I begin making my way deeper into Grandine. I am taking inspiration from the Lighthouse and Prysm documentation books, so whilst not everything that they have will be applicable to Grandine, I think it is a good base to work from.
- ### Installation
- ### Eth-docker integration
- ### Validator Client
- ### Contributing/Testing

## Specification

I have already begun to make myself familiar with Grandine and the CL in general. The Grandine Discord channel is becoming active for queries around errors from other fellows as well. This will be a good method and way to keep track of issues others are facing and it also fits in nicely with everybody working more collaboratively together.

I believe that these solutions can be implemented through research and trial and error. Since this is all new to me, I need to personally perform these tasks so that I can learn and also understand what pain points there are for new users. For more technical topics that other fellows and users are working on, I will have to rely on them to relay to me where there are errors in the current documentation and what solutions they found to get through their blockers.  

## Roadmap

**By end of July:**

   - Have Installation section complete, including support for non Linux systems

**By end of August:**

   - Have Eth-Docker integration section complete

**By end of September:**

   - Have Validator Client section complete

**By end of October:**

   - Have Contributing/Testing section complete

**By Devcon VII:**

   - Complete other sections that were identified for updates

## Possible challenges

I am still learning how to code (focusing on Rust) and building up my technical chops by learning more about the Consensus Layer and the Ethereum protocol in general. Working on this documentation for Grandine, while not as technical as other projects, will still require a great deal of technical understanding through trial and error. 

One important aspect of documentation and support is going through the steps myself, so I will be doing much testing in that sense and could face challenges and roadblocks there. However, it is better for me to discover those than others who want to use Grandine! 

There's the possibility of being sidetracked with other areas of the CL that impact Grandine and I may lose focus or get distracted. However, I anticipate that as the fellowship continues to progress, my technical understanding will ramp up and technical areas will become clearer and easier to understand. 

## Goal of the project

As stated in Grandine's first [blog post](https://medium.com/@grandine/grandine-is-open-sourced-b1815cf0ae39), their long-term goal is to help diversify Ethereum CL clients "where every client has less than 1/3 of mainnet validators share." One solution to this problem is having the support and documentation available for anybody to digest. It should be fairly easy and simple for anybody to download Grandine and use the client.
According to [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/), and more specifically [Miga Labs](https://migalabs.io/), Grandine has a 0.92% marketshare. It is difficult to say what % this could increase to or how it could be attributed to this project, but as long as Grandine's % continues to increase, I would view it as success.    

Each of the sections I mentioned above should be fully fleshed out. Currently available sections should also contain more detailed information. I also imagine that as Grandine continues pushing new releases, more sections will likely need to be published. 

## Collaborators

### Fellows 

There are several fellows that have attended the weekly Grandine calls with Saulius, who may indireclty contribute to this as they progress with their projects.

# Project Proposal

 ## eODS (enshrined Operator-Delegator Separation) specification

## Motivation

**What problem is the project solving? Why is it important?**

Today, ETH delegators allocate their principal to node operators off-protocol, via staking pools. 

The pain is that off-protocol ETH delegation is easily captured by exogenous influences, as seen today in liquid staking, leading to the centralization of staking pools, in the detriment of protocol safety. Delegators are given no real voting power, and no meaningful role in protocol.

The project addresses inefficiencies associated with the limits of what the Ethereum Protocol can detect and how it defends itself, in the context of delegated proof of stake. It also proposes a shift in validator economics *design philosophy* for the scope of leaping towards SSF(Single Slot Finality) implementation, with overall improved protocol resilience:

- The Protocol cannot see ETH delegations, so its reach and ability to control Validators is limited in that aspect. The project addresses this issue, helping the Protocol disambiguate the Validator role and "see" the staking scene actors.

  Ethereum Protocol's credibility comes from the control over the Validators that execute the protocol. But it can only control what it can see, so it's important to extend these limits, in order to allow for the Protocol to have the capacity to react with automated defense systems.

- Currently, ETH delegators do not play a [meaningful role](https://epf.wiki/#/wiki/research/eODS?id=the-role-of-delegators) in the protocol, as they don't actively participate in Consensus. We can improve this by allowing the Protocol to identify delegated stake and incentivize that role selection. Delegators under eODS model do not contribute to the economic security of FFG, i.e. Delegators do not partake in Finality (non-slashable stake), but they are able to surface discrepancies in the gadgetâ€™s functioning. Their services can be compensated by re-allocated aggregated issuance.
    
    Delegator role, under Operator-Delegator separation:
    * The curation of operator set: Opinionated delegators may decide to choose between different operators based on e.g., fees or reliability. These criteria could be part of a Validator rating system developed either on CL clients side or in-protocol.
    * The provision of non-FFG services: The delegators may be called upon to provide non-slashable, yet critical services, like:
        * input their view into censorship-resistance gadgets such as inclusion lists or multiplicity gadgets.
        * co-sign block proposals, attestations together with the bonded Gasper operators.
 
    This is important, so we can move away from the unincentivized delegate selection practiced today in delegated proof of stake, which is basically [a flawed type of voting](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/staking_2023_10#Expanding-delegate-selection-powers).
  
- Building towards the inevitable implementation of SSF, requires taking the best possible trade-offs.
Identifying, disambiguating, or solving these trade-offs is not trivial, as they depend on a wide range of challenges and limitations:
    - physical network limitations (e.g. computing power) 
    - technical limitations (e.g. per slot BLS signatures aggregation)
    - not-just-technical fundamentals (e.g. community goals and values vs. out-of-protocol market forces)

  This is important in our journey to build Ethereum as the envisioned global-scale network, because in that scenario, single-slot finality is not only desirable but most likely mandatory, and I feel that if we're building towards the right goals, we better be building towards SSF. Regardless what the goals set by the Ethereum community turn out to be, enshrining ODS would help the community impose those goals, by exercising better control over the validators that execute the protocol, while addressing the challenges mentioned above.
 
- A daunting aspect about building towards SSF is the need to drastically reduce the validator set size (measured in *individual message signers*, not in *stake weight*), while encouraging an ever increasing validators count, for the scope of overall increased resilience. 
These seemingly conflictual goals can be resolved by the realization that we need to move away from the concept that every participant signs in every slot.
In the SSF context, we can assume a limit of 1.8 million$ BLS signatures that could be processed every slot. 
The second dimension of eODS (vertical separation) proposes the reduction of the Validators-as-Finality-participants count (Heavy services providers), to ~10,000, reducing the number of BLS signatures that need to be processed every slot, even assuming the two-round consensus protocol SSF would inevitably use, thus significantly reducing consensus node overhead. The Light layer participants would be encouraged to participate in as many numbers as possible, and rotated in random selections.
The number of heavy tier participants is constrained by the efficiency of cryptographic constructions (aggregating signatures), but as cryptographic methods or simply hardware progress, the number of "seats" may increase. 

    This is important for hardening protocol resilience(a wider array of proposers, attesters, whistle-blowers and censorship-resistance agents), even in the perspective of exogenous (or even self imposed, endogenous) limitations.

- Liquid staking centralization is a well known issue in the space and exploring solutions to it is one important topic of the protocol's [roadmap](https://epf.wiki/#/wiki/research/roadmap). The project proposes a mix between Approach 1 and 2 presented in the [Sticking to 8192 signatures per slot post SSF](https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989) research post:
  * A heavy layer, liquefied as it is today, all in on decentralized staking pools with help from enshrined protocol gadgets (e.g., LSM-type enshrined gadgets);
  * A solo-staker-friendly light layer as the second-tier, with its own Light LSTs. And since ETH staked as provision of Light services is non-slashable, the LLSTs (LightLSTs) would be mostly risk-free and could be used as pristine collateral type in the app layer, e.g. a version of the governance-minimized, ungoverned RAI stablecoin that accepts staked ETH.


**What area of the protocol will be affected?**

Implementing the project implies changes to the Execution Layer (EL) and the Beacon Chain (CL) specifications.


## Project description
My proposed solution is an implementation of eODS, implying a **separation** of the **Validator** role, implemented at protocol level:

### Unbundling the Validator role between Operator and Delegator. 

This project proposes a way to enshrine the delegation process.
The purpose is to map in-protocol Principal-Agent relationship, in the context of ETH staking.

The current proposal aims to solve the above inefficiencies by providing delegators, with a mechanism to deposit / consolidate and then delegate their principal. Capital providers can then delegate stake to another (possibly new) targeted validator (node operator), thus allowing for delegators to be opinionated in their operators of choice. This all in-protocol, in particular not involving the deposit contract in a different way than a regular deposit is. 

### Non-FFG/light protocol services, as Delegators role selection

The second part of the project consists of the conceptual design of a plug-and-play interface for future integration of protocol services and an MVP specification of the interface.

The vertical separation unlocks the introduction of two distinct types of future protocol services, each tier inducing within itself a market structure of delegators and operators:
  * Heavy Services
  * Light Services

Future Light & Heavy, Validator provided, protocol services: 
![Future Validator services](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SylCaqvX0.png)

#### Conceptual design of the plug-n-play interface for adding protocol (heavy / light) services:
* General design principle
    * Design constrains
    * Identify light & heavy operators and other stakeholders
    * Identify services
        * heavy: Finality gadget 
        * light: Censorship-resistance gadgets (e.g. Inclusion lists, Multiplicity gadgets)
    * Economics of heavy layer
    * Economics of light layer 
    * MVI for heavy layer (deduct from issuance curve to derive MVI  for light layer)
* Specification notes referencing:
    * An adaptation of the slashing mechanism to account for partially slashable light services
    * Liveness
    * Protocol safety

## Part 1 - eODS Specification
**How will you implement your solutions? Give details and more technical information on the project.**

### What are the minimum set of requirements for eODS design?
- New entity in beacon state: Delegators as a new class, similar to validators but with different signature domain and participation flags indices
- Add state Delegator index & balances
- Mapping in-protocol Principal-Agent relationship by explicitating a way for Delegators to transfer ETH to Validators and introducing Validator *"liabilities"* towards Delegators
- Allow for delegator triggered `0x01` withdrawals.
- Define actions set/ attributes for delegators

### Specification overview

A sketch of the proposed specification changes to the **execution layer** is included below:

#### Staking-deposit-cli
Stakers deposit ETH in the protocol, provided `amount` >= `MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`. During [deposit](###Deposit), a forked staking-deposit-cli will allow depositors to set a boolean `is_delegator` field to `True` or `False`, alongside the target validator's pubkey and withdrawal_credentials.
#### Deposit contract 
The deposit contract will have to gain the following arguments: `is_delegator`, `target_pubkey` and `target_withdrawal_credentials`
#### Deposit operation
- Add new fields `is_delegator`, `target_pubkey` and `target_withdrawal_credentials` to the structure denoting the deposit operation on EL 

A sketch of the proposed specification changes to the **consensus layer** is included below:

The eODS specification is to be built upon existing specifications of Ethereum components, i.e. [Electra consensus-specs.](../../electra/beacon_chain.md) 

- Add  new beacon-chain `class Delegator` 
- New `get_delegator_from_deposit` function
- Modified `apply_deposit` function to accommodate delegations
- Add `is_delegator == False` condition for new deposited validators to enter activation queue
- Add delegations to block processing:
    - Constructing a delegator registry along side validator registry inside `BeaconState`. (`add_delegator_to_registry`)
    - Get `process_deposit_request` to handle delegation deposits & `process_consolidation_request` to handle delegated validators consolidations
- Add mapping between `state.balances[index]` and `state.delegator_balances[index]`
    - Add new `Domaintype` to sign delegation messages 
    - Modify `The beacon block body` to add a list of included delegation messages. 
    - Add `DelegationMessage` containing the pubkey and the withdrawal credentials of the delegate validator.
    - Add `Delegation` consisting of the signed delegation message, the signature and an `epoch` parameter to set the valability of the delegation message.
    - The function `process_operations` is modified to support all of the new functionality
- Enable Delegator triggerable exits (0x01 credentials).

:::warning
During the implementation of the project some of these changes might  be partially extended, get altered or be removed.

## Part 2 - Research Delegator role selection & incentivization

Part 1 of the project opens the possibility to enshrine Delegators and allow them to be opiniated in their Validator selection.

Part 2 of this project will focus on researching and developing a conceptual design on what consensus role can delegators have, and how can the Protocol incentivise that role selection.

Interwining IL and ePBS with the PoS mechanism is not trivial (or even ideal), so abstracting the "discrepancies surfacing" type of protocol services in the Delegator's actions set, could ease some of the design around e.g. CR gadgets

Possible compatible role selection for Delegators:
- whistleblower
- sync committee
- PTC 
- Validator scoring on light CL clients, operated by Delegators 
- Lght services validator duties, e.g.:
    *  co-signing block proposals, attestations
    The staking public key for a Validator for a slot would be set to `validator_pubkey` $+$ `delegator_pubkey`. 
    Slashing would be adapted in this case to account for `delegator_pubkey` (two slashable messages could have different delegator keys, but they would have the same validator key)
    *  signing in for censorship-resistance gadgets, e.g. Inclusion Lists $Î”$ evaluation, multiplicity gadgets

## Roadmap

*What is your proposed timeline?*

The proposed timeline for the project is **6 months**, split in 2 work-packages as follows:

*Outline parts of the project and insight on how much time it will take to execute them.*

### I. Part 1 - eODS Specification

1. Write the fully-fleshed specs of eODS in 8 weeks (**Week 6 - Week 13**) including getting feedback from mentors.

2. Write case study pyspec tests and error handling, including getting feedback from mentors in 4 weeks (**Week 14 - Week 17**).

### II. Part 2 - Research Delegator role selection & incentivization

1. I've done some of the work related to this phase in the weeks preceding EPF, especially during EPS, I plan to have the conceptual design for future integration of light protocol services done in in 4 weeks (**Week 17 - Week 21**) including getting feedback from mentors.
2. I plan to write the as much of the afferent specs, including getting feedback from mentors and case study tests, and continue past the EPF program time spam for as long as it needs to finish up this subfeature. I estimate I will fit in an additional 4-8 weeks (**Week 21+**).

## Possible challenges

What are the limitations and issues you may need to overcome?

* Electra fork specs in active development

* Data complexity
    :::warning
    Memory cost of adding extra beacon chain state elements
    :::
    Consuming computations to consider: 
    * signature verification 

* Integrating eODS with ongoing R&D on e.g. ePBS, ILs will most likely not be a trivial task

* Defining actions set/ attributes for delegators will have to take into account aspects like existing protocol incentives and maintaining PoS safety constrains

## Goal of the project

*What does success look like? Describe the end goal of the project, scope, state and impact for the project to be considered finished and successful.*

The end goal of this project is to fully specificate eODS.

Expected impact/followup:
- eODS EIP
    - Part 1 can be functional on its own
    - Part 2 can be added later
- I would conssider a success if my project would stand as a starting base for a future POC and client implementation for
    - full node
    - light client

I see the following realistic scenario:
- Finalize Part 1, and the conceptual design of Part 2 and as much as possible of Part 2 specs, during EPF period. 
- Finalize Part 2 specs in the months following the EPF if not done during the EPF project time span.
- Propose eODS EIP according to Part 1 specs
- Propose EIP according to Part 2 specs

# Project Proposal: 
# Native Support For Ephemery Testnet Implementation on Client Pair (Besu & Teku) Clients

## Tagline
Enabling seamless integration of the Ephemery testnet into Ethereum clients with dynamic genesis support.

## Motivation
Ephemery testnet offers an automatically resetting environment ideal for short-term testing of applications, validators, and client changes. It addresses problems like state bloat and lack of testnet funds in long-running testnets by resetting to genesis, clearing validators, and refilling faucets. This keeps the network small and easy to bootstrap. 

The primary challenge is managing the dynamic genesis, which resets periodically, unlike other networks with hardcoded genesis. 

Integrating Ephemery into clients like Teku and Besu enhances its usability by allowing configuration via a simple flag. This integration promotes experimentation and validation, strengthening the Ethereum ecosystem. 

The project focuses on client configuration and genesis handling, aiming to streamline testnet setup and operation.

## Project Description
The proposed solution involves implementing native support for the Ephemery testnet in both Teku (an Ethereum consensus client) and Besu (an Ethereum execution client). This will be achieved by introducing a new --ephemery flag that handles the dynamic genesis requirement. 

**The solution includes:**
- Developing a mechanism within each client to calculate or download the new genesis periodically.
- Creating an "Ephemery lib" or submodule within each client to handle genesis generation and reset functionality.
- Ensuring seamless integration with existing client architecture to support Ephemery's unique requirements.

## Specification

The detailed spec can be be found here [eip6916](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6916)

**Feasibility Study:**

- Assess current client architectures and identify potential integration points for Ephemery.
- We conducted detailed technical analyses of clients, especially focusing on the reset function.
- Compile a feasibility report with findings and recommendations.

**Genesis Functionality:**

- Implement a dynamic genesis handling mechanism within both Teku and Besu clients.
- Develop a library/submodule in Java to manage genesis calculation or retrieval.

**Client Integration:**

- Modify the initialization process in both clients to recognize the --ephemery flag.
- Ensure that the clients can fetch or compute the genesis block before starting.

**Documentation and Tutorials:**
- Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials for developers to understand and utilize the new Ephemery functionality.

**Website Development:**
- Build an Ephemery website featuring a reset countdown, project overview, and documentation.

**Technical Details:**

**Teku Modifications:**
- Integrate the Ephemery lib to handle consensus layer genesis.
- Ensure compatibility with Teku's existing architecture for seamless integration.

**Besu Modifications:**
- Integrate the Ephemery lib for execution layer genesis handling.
- Align with Besu's architecture to maintain performance and stability.

# EVM memory repricing

## Motivation

Efficiency gains from hardware advancements, and client code optimizations warrants periodic repricing of gas costs.

## Project description

The EVM's memory is a **word-addressed byte array** that stores its **volatile state**. Accessing memory, like any instruction in the EVM, incurs fees in a unit called **gas**.

Gas does not measure the direct cost of execution, but rather the _computational effort_ required by a node's hardware to execute EVM instructions. Transactors pay for per unit of gas at market value which ultimately determines the execution cost.

This project focuses on analyzing the gas costs associated with EVM memory opcodes `MSTORE`, `MSTORE8`, and `MLOAD`.

## Specification
TBD.

## Roadmap
TBD.

## Possible challenges

Gas metering is an open problem in Ethereum given the spectrum of underlying hardware and software. It will be challenging to come up with a reliable analysis.

## Goal of the project

The goal of the project is provide data points to support repricing of memory usage in the EVM.

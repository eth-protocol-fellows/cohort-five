## Getting started

The EPF is a fully permissionless and open program. Anybody is welcome to participate. All resources and work being done can be found in this repository. 

First, read the [program guide](/program-guide/README.md) and [FAQ](/program-guide/faq.md). To start with the program, use this repository, check the [guide for participating](/program-guide/participation-guide.md) and open a PR to add your development updates. Find more resources about the protocol in [EPF.wiki](https://epf.wiki/#/wiki/epf).

## Communication  

The main communication channel with other participants, mentors and organizers is in R&D Discord. If you don't have access, contact the cohort organizers. 

### Calls

There will be two regular weekly calls throughout the program. 

#### Standup calls 

Standup calls provide an opportunity to share your weekly updates with other fellows. These calls serve to discuss progress of projects, current issues participants are facing, their open questions and comments raised in development updates. Standup calls are dedicated to participants and their discussion, some mentors might show up occasionally. Standups occur weekly every Monday, 15:00 UTC. Use [this link](https://meet.ethquokkaops.io/epf-standup) to attend.

#### Office hours

In addition to the weekly standup calls, we hold Office Hours calls which can be focused on specific topics proposed in advance. Find the upcoming call agenda in [Issues](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/issues). Anybody can propose topics for this call by commenting on its tracking issue. Office Hours are regularly happening on every Tuesday, 15:00 UTC.

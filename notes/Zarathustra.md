# Introduction

Hey there,

My name is Michael, and I use Zarathustra as a pseudonym. I am excited about the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship and the opportunity to dive into core development work, inspired by the people I've met at various Ethereum hackathons over the past three years.

My primary focus is on autonomous multi-agent systems, with or without AI. For me, autonomy represents freedom, which I define as the ability and willingness to take responsibility for oneself. Furthermore, I feel strongly about privacy, which is eroding quickly in our modern world. It always surprises me how easily people are willing to give up their autonomy and privacy for the sake of convenience. I believe automation should enhance, not compete with, autonomy, allowing individuals to retain control over their actions and decisions.

To preserve autonomy, I am a strong advocate of open-source development â€” I lean strongly towards "it's open source or nothing". Open-source software is a prerequisite for true autonomy, as it ensures transparency and control. In the same vein, decentralization is crucial as it creates trust-minimized systems by eliminating the need to trust any single entity. Lastly, I'll add that I hate code, meaning I like to have as little of it as necessary, and in that regard, I consider myself a minimalist.

Looking forward to collaborating and learning with all of you!

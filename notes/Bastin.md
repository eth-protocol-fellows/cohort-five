## Introduction

Hi, I'm Bastin, a simple developer. I'm interested in all things blockchain. have been reading up on the core protocol lately and I think that's where I want to focus on.

I'm looking forward to this EPF and I will try my best to produce value.

## My EPF Journey

Here in [this note](https://hackmd.io/@Bastin/r1oxkeNVR) I write down my thoughts and plans in an unorganized manner. this can be considered my thought process through out this program, and these notes are what will later on turn to the development updates.

I have not yet decided on what to work on. at first I was keen on performance optimizations on the execution layer. specifically optimistic parallel execution of the transactions in the validators. but I then realized that it might not be valuable due to the way the protocol works.
So I am looking around to find a suitable idea to work on. I will update this later on.

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Dan Goron, proud participant in EPF cohort 5, working on an implementation of eODS (enshrined Operator-Delegator Separation).

Before EPF, I joined EPS, being now an active contributor to the [EPF wiki](https://epf.wiki/). Check out my üÜí [EPS contributor POAP](https://collectors.poap.xyz/token/7125322)!

## My EPS journey
During the 10 weeks of study group, I deep dived into validator economics and possible solutions to liquid staking centralization, as  key factors in paving the road towards SSF, with the best possible trade-offs. Here are [my EPS notes](https://github.com/gorondan/protocol-studies/blob/main/notes/gorondan.md).

## Leaping into EPF

I feel that EPF is a great pathway for community members into Ethereum Protocol core research and development and a great opportunity for me to bring my personal contribution to Ethereum. Programs like this provide us, fellows, with the support and resources needed to jump in, harden our understanding of the protocol and put in the much needed work. 
During my EPS research phase, I read [Robust Incentives Group](https://efdn.notion.site/RIG-Open-Problems-ROPs-c11382c213f949a4b89927ef4e962adf)'s research work and found plenty of synergies with the topics covered by the Berlin based EF research team. 

Apart from my own research on validator economics (and how it intersects with SSF, ET, ePBS), Barnab√© Monnot's [research post](https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683) on unbundling staking, sets the cornerstone for my [eODS implementation proposal](), so it came naturally for me to ask him to review the pages I worked on for the EPS wiki and to mentor my EPF project (for which I am most grateful üôè). 

I also hope to find synergies with other fellows and previous work done in my area of interest.

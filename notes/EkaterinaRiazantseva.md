## Intro
Hi everyone!

My name is Katya (Ekaterina Riazantseva). I am a web3 developer with a passion for blockchain. I am here to dive into Ethereum Core Development and Research and contribute to the Ethereum Protocol.

## Project idea

Project Idea: I came across several ideas, and **PeerDAS** caught my attention. I have already built on DA Layers during hackathons and am familiar with the basics of Data Availability and DA Sampling. Therefore, I would like to dive into this field and find out how I can contribute to it.

Draft: [EIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594).

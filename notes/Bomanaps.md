# Introduction

Hi, I'm Mercy Boma Naps, and I'm thrilled to be joining EPF. I'm entering the ecosystem permissionlessly and will be focusing on a project in the Testing space. My primary interest lies in testing and security, with a particular focus on cross-layer testing and consensus testing.

## Interests

I'm particularly passionate about exploring testing methodologies and enhancing security measures within blockchain technology. My focus areas include:

- **Cross-Layer Testing**: Ensuring interoperability and cohesion between different layers of the blockchain protocol.
- **Consensus Testing**: Contributing to the robustness and reliability of consensus mechanisms.

## Weekly Updates

I'll be sharing my weekly updates on my [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@u1hkHdIvSFKF7TfMsZSBow).

# Introduction 

Hi :wave: 

my name is Manas (hopinheimer) and I'm thrilled to be part of the fifth cohort of **Ethereum Protocol Fellowship** and I'm currently researching on analysis of PeerDAS. I'm also a current grad student at NYU

Before EPF, I joined **EPFsg** and currently an active contributor to [EPF wiki](https://epf.wiki), I hope to get a EPFsg contributor POAP :grin: mario please?

## Standing on the shoulders of giants 

Over of the course of five cohorts EPF has created exceptional protocol engineers by providing them with the right resources to understand and contribute to Ethereum core protocol development and research. 

I intend to maximally contribute to Ethereum protocol's development and research with the help of resources provided to me by EPF.

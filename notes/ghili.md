# Introduction

Hello,

My name is Ghilia (ghili) Weldesselasie and I'm excited to be a member of the fifth cohort of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship.

I'm interested in various topics in mechanism design and cryptography, notably: MEV, erasure code commitments and data availability schemes, as well as efficient software (in Rust).

I'm looking to grow as a developer and become more familiar with low-level parts of the Ethereum stack, like p2p networking and RLP encoding/decoding.

You can find me on Twitter [@ghiliweld](https://twitter.com/ghiliweld), I always love to chat about Ethereum and surrounding topics.

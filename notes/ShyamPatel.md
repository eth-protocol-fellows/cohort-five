## Introduction

Hi, my name is Shyam Patel (kira), and I'm excited to be a part of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF) cohort 5. I'm currently exploring several ideas/projects that I can work on during the fellowship. 

Before joining EPF, I was and still am an active participant in the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Study Group (EPFsg), where I contributed to the [EPF wiki](https://epf.wiki/). Check out my [EPFsg contributor POAP](https://collectors.poap.xyz/token/7125592)!

During the 10-week study group, I delved into several interesting areas and even contributed by writing respective Wiki Pages like MEV, PBS, BLS, CL etc.

## Leaping into EPF

I believe that EPF is the perfect opportunity, for a protocol dev to dive deep and engage in Ethereum Protocol core research and development. It offers a unique opportunity for me to contribute to Ethereum meaningfully. Programs like this provide us, fellows, with the support and resources needed to deepen our understanding of the protocol and make significant contributions.

During my EPS research phase, I briefly studied the PBS and some ePBS solutions, currently studying Notes and Specs by Potuz and terence [Enshrined PBS spec notes](https://hackmd.io/@potuz/rJ9GCnT1C), [ePBS Forkchoice annotated Spec](https://hackmd.io/@potuz/SJdXM43x0) and [ePBS validator spec](https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/epbs-annotated-validator).

In addition I'm also exploring other In-protocol PBS solutions/ideas if they exist. I'm also exploring other ideas/projects that piques my interest.

# Introduction

Hey there, I am Hangleang. I'm participating in the Protocol Fellowship to advance my expertise in decentralized technologies and also to contribute to open-source projects.

I'm interested in various topics in mechanism design and cryptography, notably: verkle tree, stateless client, light client, and data availability schemes.

I would like to be more familiar with low-level parts of the Ethereum stack, like p2p networking and SSZ serialization.

You can find me on Twitter [@HangleangS](https://twitter.com/HangleangS), I always love to chat about Ethereum and surrounding topics. I recently tweet about ["The demand of Ethereum block space"](https://twitter.com/HangleangS/status/1801524889268142258), would love to know your opinions.

Lastly, thanks to @ghili. I'm permissionlessly fork your note, cause we have some interests in common.

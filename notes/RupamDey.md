## Introduction

Hi, I am Rupam Dey, and I'm happy to be selected as a fellow in EPF5. Before EPF, I had been contributing to Reth mostly and a bit to lambdaworks, constantine and alloy. I was also been following the EPF study group. 

## Interests

My primary interest lies within the Consensus Layer, Cryptography and Verkle. I have been exploring light clients for a while and would probably want to contribute to the same.

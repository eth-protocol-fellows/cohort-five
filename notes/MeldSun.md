# Introduction 

Hi I am Meldsun currently studing as much as possible to contribute to Ethereum core protocol development and research.
Attending the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Study Group (EPFsg) was an invaluable experience that significantly advanced my understanding. This fellowship is the next crucial step in my journey. 

I am interested in things relative to the CL, EL, devp2p, EVM, ZK proofs and future features to come on the Ethereum roadmap (PBS, Verkle Trees).

I also contribute to [EPF wiki](https://epf.wiki). My next step is to decide on what to focus.
